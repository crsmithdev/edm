# TODO

## High Priority

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Find permissively-licensed EDM music files for integration tests
  - Current test fixtures use synthetic audio (click tracks, beat patterns)
  - Need real EDM tracks with known structure for structure analysis testing
  - Look for Creative Commons or public domain EDM tracks
  - Required annotations: section boundaries and labels (intro, buildup, drop, breakdown, outro)
- [ ] Wrap common groups of tasks in scripts for `uv run` (e.g. format, lint, test)

## Low Priority / Nice to Have

- [ ] Add openspec link / one-liner to claude.md
- [ ] Add project context to claude.md
