Goals:
- Getting you the correct context instantly, minimizing the need to search or rediscover things
- Optimizing you for best performance, efficiency and quality of responses

Considering the contents of hooks, slash commands, and contexts:
- are hooks firing properly, injecting the correct context automatically?
- are slash commands working as intended?  Run test cases for each.
- do contexts contain useful information for you?
- are contexts written in a consistent style that best suits you?
- are there areas where information is duplicated across contexts without obvious benefit?
- are there cases where contexts are being injected too much, or too little?
- are there any cases where things should be moved to different hooks?
- is the split between user- and project-level, if applicable, correct?
- what is the cost on token and session usage?
- are there optimizations you can suggest?
- is there information missing that would be helpful to you?
