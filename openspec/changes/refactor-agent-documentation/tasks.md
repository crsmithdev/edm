- [ ] 1.2 Create migration checklist for all Python guidelines

## 2. CLAUDE.md Refactoring (Interactive with User Approval)
- [ ] 2.1 Present current Python "Code Style" section vs proposed change, get approval
- [ ] 2.2 Present current Python "Type Hints" section vs proposed change, get approval
- [ ] 2.3 Present current Python "Testing" section vs proposed change, get approval
- [ ] 2.4 Present current Python "Error Handling" section vs proposed change, get approval
- [ ] 2.5 Present current Python "Async" section vs proposed change, get approval
- [ ] 2.6 Present current Python "Data Validation" section vs proposed change, get approval
- [ ] 2.7 Present current Python "Logging" section vs proposed change, get approval
- [ ] 2.8 Present current Python "Documentation" section vs proposed change, get approval
- [ ] 2.9 Present "Detailed Guidelines" navigation addition, get approval
- [ ] 2.10 Apply approved changes to CLAUDE.md

## 3. docs/python-style.md Expansion

- [ ] 3.2 Add code examples for import organization
- [ ] 3.3 Add code examples for error handling patterns
- [ ] 3.4 Add code examples for async patterns
- [ ] 3.5 Add code examples for Pydantic validation
- [ ] 3.6 Add code examples for logging patterns
- [ ] 3.7 Add configuration examples (Ruff, mypy)
- [ ] 3.8 Ensure all content from CLAUDE.md is preserved with better examples

## 4. Validation
- [ ] 4.1 Verify CLAUDE.md contains only language-agnostic and high-level guidance
- [ ] 4.2 Verify docs/python-style.md has all Python-specific details with examples
- [ ] 4.3 Verify no Python content is lost during refactoring
- [ ] 4.4 Verify navigation link to python-style.md works
- [ ] 4.5 Verify single source of truth for Python guidelines
