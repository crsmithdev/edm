# DVC Pipeline Configuration
# Data version control for annotations, models, and generated outputs
# See: https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/project-structure/dvcyaml-files

# Pipelines will be defined here as ML workflows develop
# Example stages:
# - feature_extraction: Extract audio features for ML training
# - model_training: Train structure detection models
# - evaluation: Run accuracy evaluation on test sets
# - annotation_generation: Generate annotations for new tracks

# For now, data/ directory is tracked with data.dvc
# Future stages will be added as MLPIVOT implementation progresses
